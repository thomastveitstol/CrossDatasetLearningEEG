Some suggestions for experiments to run:

    1) Cross dataset learning for age prediction
        Simply train a DL classifier to predict the age, given the EEG of a subject. The research questions are as
        follows:
            - Does inclusion of other datasets improve the performance on single datasets? Compare training on multiple
            datasets with only training on a single one, for all datasets available
            - Given that one has trained a DL model on multiple datasets, how well does it perform on an unseen dataset?
            - How much can the performance on the unseen dataset be improved by unsupervised domain adaptation?

    2) Dementia/MCI/healthy prediction by first pre-training on pretext tasks, using other datasets
        Do dementia predictions. Compare pre-training with not pre-training. The DL models can either be frozen or
        fine-tuned (feature extraction or weight initialisation). Maybe follow the procedure of Banville et al. (2021)
        as closely as possible. Think of which results should be presented in a paper, and how to present them. The
        pretext tasks are available elsewhere, and also include age prediction (which is clearly the easiest one). The
        research questions reads as follows:
            - How well can dementia/mci/healthy be predicted?
            - How does pre-training compare to no pre-training? Which pre-training performs the best?
